# Project 
# Intrusion Detection System for DoS and DDoS Attacks Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting **Denial of Service (DoS)** and **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks in real-time network traffic using **machine learning** techniques. It uses PCAP files to analyze network packets and applies an unsupervised learning model to identify anomalies in traffic patterns.
# Project Features
- Analyze packet capture (`.pcap`) files using **Scapy**
- Extract useful features like packet size, packet rate, and protocols
- Apply **Isolation Forest** (unsupervised ML algorithm) to detect anomalies
- Visualize traffic behavior and detected attacks using **Matplotlib**
- Log suspicious traffic data into a **SQLite** database
# Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Scapy** – for packet analysis
- **Pandas** – for data processing
- **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning (Isolation Forest)
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **SQLite** – for logging detected attacks
- **Google Colab** – for cloud-based execution

# Internship Experience
# Intern – Mosys Consultancy Service Private Limited  
**Duration:** [January & 2025] – [june & 2025]  
**Location:** Bangalore ,Karnataka
During my internship, I worked on a real-time institutional repository project using **EPrints**, a digital library platform. I gained strong hands-on experience in both backend and server-side tasks.

**Key Contributions:**
- Installed and configured the **EPrints** repository system on Ubuntu Linux
- Integrated **REST API** support for accessing and managing repository data
- Customized repository **web pages** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Worked with a **live production server**, handled Apache configurations
- Gained proficiency in **Linux (Ubuntu)** terminal commands and troubleshooting
- Modified and maintained backend scripts for improved functionality

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
*EPrints, Linux (Ubuntu), Apache, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST API, Terminal*
> *This internship helped me understand real-world deployment, server operations, and how web technologies work in institutional research systems.*
